description: On April 18, 1861 Lee was offered field command of the United States
  Army. On the following day, he received word that Virginia had seceeded from the
  Union; he submitted his letter of resignation from the United States Army on April
  20. Three days later, Lee accepted the position of commander of Virginia forces.
  From this point onward, Lee's identity became intrinsically linked to the Confederate
  cause. At the age of 55, on May 31, 1862, Robert E. Lee was assigned to command
  the troops which he named "The Army of Northern Virginia".
